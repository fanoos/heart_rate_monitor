# What is the Problem?
Low blood sugar levels, known as hypoglycemia, in people with diabetes may cause potentially dangerous changes in heart rate. Someone with type 1 diabetes is found dead in the morning in an undisturbed bed after having been observed in apparently good health the day before.

# Solution: Do Hero Heart Rate Monitoring
A wearable Heart Rate Device measuring the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate is a promising device for the early detection of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, in type 1 diabetes. System sends immediate alerts to your smart device or receiver when your heartrate is trending too high or too low.
